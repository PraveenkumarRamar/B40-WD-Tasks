Objects are important datatypes in Javascript and it more different than the primitive 
data types.Primitive data types are(number, string, boolean,etc......).In primitive data
type it can  hold only one value,but Objects data types can hold many values by key:value 
These are variables called function and methods,every object have some properties,
the properties associated with some values,the values are accessed 
by property names.

for example
var myPhone = new object();
myPhone.name ="oppo";
myPhone.year = 2021;

the values are accessed by the keys;
myPhone.year
output;
2021
