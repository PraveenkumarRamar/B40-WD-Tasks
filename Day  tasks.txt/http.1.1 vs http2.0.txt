What is http?

http = hypertext transfer protocol;
It is created in 1997(http 1.1) and later developed in 2015(http 2.0)SPDY protocol.

The user sent the request to server and the server response to the request.

The http is network delay sensitive it senses that if there is less  network delay
the page loads more faster.Then http 2.0 is discovered and the http 2.0 is more faster 
than http 1.1 ,because multiplexing is used.

HTTP 1.1;

1.It works on the textual format;
2.Head of line blocking ,TCP connection blocked all other request until the response 
doesn't receive. all other information related to the header file is repeated in every 
request.
3.It uses request resource inlining for getting multiple pages.
4.It compresses the data by itself.

HTTP 2.0;

1.It works on the binary number.
2.it uses multiplexing so one TCP connection required for multiple requests.
3.it uses PUSH frame for collecting multiple pages like CSS,HTML,Javascript;
4.It uses PHACk for compresses the data.
